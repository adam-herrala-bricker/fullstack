# fullstack

This repository contains exercises completed for the University of Helsinki's fullstack web development course (https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

Additional information for part 11:

- Link to second repository: https://github.com/adam-herrala-bricker/full-stack-open-pokedex
- The CI/CD pipeline for ex. 11.20 used the refactored "blog list" app from part 7.

Links to online applications:

- Phonebook backend (part 3): https://restless-hill-5074.fly.dev/
- Pokedex (part 11): https://hb-pokedex.onrender.com/
- CI/CD blog list (ex. 11.20): https://hb-blog-app-demo.onrender.com (test out by logging in as user 'randy_15' with password 'password')

**NOTE:** Since fly limits the number of applications for free users, I can't guarantee how long these links will be active for.
